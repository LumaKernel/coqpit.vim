## TODO

- [ ] Make logger to ease debugging

- [ ] User Events
  - [ ] After Launching
  - [ ] After Open Goals/Infos Window
    - useful for customizing the window settings
    - like `cursorline`, `wrap`, etc...
  - Think up any more

- [ ] Vim version and support checking

- [ ] Auto tests for editorconfig

- [ ] write help@ja
- [x] setup editorconfig

Not easy ones.

- [ ] Goals syntax
- [ ] Infos syntax

- [ ] Vim friendly Search Interface
- [ ] Compile Coq in Vim
  - [ ] `rerun after compile`
- [ ] Jump to Axiom
  - Sounds good for rewriting `admit.`
- [ ] Coq setting (not coqpit.vim) by Global Vim Variables
  - Hm, it's nasty... make just a function to configure.
- [ ] Query command
  - simply, one command ?
  - prompt buffer ?
  - or using other plugin ?
  - `prompt()` ?
- [ ] Diff mode (like Coq IDE)

- [ ] Rewrite to Promise for the future
  - [ ] Implementation
  - [ ] Test


## Not clear about CoqTop

- [ ] Arguments `editId` and `verbose` for `Add` command.
- [ ] Arguments `routeID` for `Query` command.
- [ ] `-async-proof on` option. It's buggy with Neovim.
